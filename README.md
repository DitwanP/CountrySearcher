### What I learned

One of the most valuable lessons I gained from this project was understanding the concept of paginating data and implementing an infinite scroll behavior to load additional content. Upon examining the provided API for the project, I noticed its subpar performance. As a result, I opted to simulate data loading from an API by introducing a random timeout.

By simulating the request behavior, I successfully paginated the project's data and integrated infinite scroll functionality, which activates when users reach a predefined threshold.

In terms of styling, I chose a unique approach to this project, granting myself creative freedom and the opportunity to delve into more complex CSS techniques. This decision proved to be a great learning experience, as it allowed me to explore the trade-offs between aesthetics and performance, particularly when dealing with elements like blur, which can significantly impact a website's overall performance.

I also learned that designing is tricky and I'm not very good at it for now. ðŸ˜„

### Continued development

I want to focus on optomizing my sites for a more speedy website. I want to find a good balance between visually pleasing and snappy. I also want to learn more about incorporating things like smooth scrolling and animations triggered by scroll.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is a given but most problems can usually be solved by reading the docs, extremely useful.
- [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/) - I used this site to source my svg icons.
